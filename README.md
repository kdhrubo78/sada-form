# Introduction

This is a Spring Boot Application that uses Camunda 8 tasklist API to render 

- Inbox (list of tasks)
- Forms (form based on the form key in the task object)


This application makes use of :

 - Tasklist V2 API (branch : *main*)
 - Tasklist v1 API (deprecated and will be removed in Camunda 8.10) (branch: *tasklist_v1*)
